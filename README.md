4. if you have any useful commands you can think of contact me! =)



# Keeper Chatgame general

I am a huge Dungeon Keeper fan, so I started to create this Keeper Chatgame.
Right now it is kinda small and there is not much to do, but I will update it every few weeks.
If you have any great ideas how to improve it just contact me. =)



# Keeper Chatgame Commands

1. !startgame --> it will ask you if you want to play good or evil (the creatures are diffrent)
2. !good --> you will start as a good Keeper
3. !evil --> you will start as an evil Keeper
4. !slapimp --> join the goldevent (more information about that in the next section)
5. !showoff --> join the lure creatureevent (more information about that in the next section)
6. !gold --> it will show you your amount of gold
7. !lure --> you can lure creatures outside of the "lure creatureevent", it costs 2000 gold
8. !creatures --> it will show you, how many and which creatures you have
9. !attack_username --> you attack with 10 creatures, it costs 500 Gold (you can only attack if the enemy (username) has at least 10 creatures and 1500 Gold)
10. more will come!!!

# Keeper Chatgame Goldevent

It is really simple. 

Every 30 minutes the bot will ask you to write "!slapimp". 

If you do that you join the event. If more people join the reward is getting bigger, after a time the bot will announce the winner of the event. The winner ist randomly selected and gets alot more gold than the rest of the players.



# Keeper Chatgame lure Creatureevent

The bot will ask you to show off your dungeon. 

If you write !showoff into the chat. You will be rewarded with 1-3 creatures. 

Which creatures you will get, depends if you are evil or good. Better creatures are more rare.



# Keeper Chatgame Creatures

Right now there are 3 creatures available.

1. Imp (neutral)
2. Thief (good)
3. Bug (evil)



# Keeper Chatgame Attack_username details

Like in Dungeon Keeper you can or need to fight. =D

If you attack someone, your 10 strongest creatures will attack the enemy. Every creature fights 1 creature. There is always a random factor in it, so if the same creatures are fighting it will not end always in a draw.
For every surviving creature you gain 150 gold. So it is possible to triple your costs. =D

In addition, there is a 5% chance on each win to capture the defeated creature.



# just some words

I hope you are having fun playing this game. If you have any ideas or you find some bugs just tell me. I will take every useful input! = D

PS.: Working on an other chatbotgame right now!!!

Thank you for playing!
