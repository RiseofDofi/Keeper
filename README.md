# Keeper Chatgame general

I am a huge Dungeon Keeper fan, so I started to create this Keeper Chatgame.
Right now it is kinda small and there is not much to do, but I will update it every few weeks.
If you have any great ideas how to improve it just contact me. =)



# Keeper Chatgame Commands

1. !startgame --> it will ask you if you want to play good or evil (the creatures are diffrent)
2. !good --> you will start as a good Keeper
3. !evil --> you will start as an evil Keeper
4. !gold --> it will show you your amount of gold
5. !lure --> you can lure creatures, it costs 300 gold
6. !lure 5 --> you can lure any number of times. In this case it would do the lure command 5 times
7. !creatures --> it will show you, how many and which creatures you have
8. !attack username --> you attack with 10 creatures, it costs 500 gold (you can only attack if the enemy (username) has at least 10 creatures)
9. !torture creature (for example: !torture imp) --> torture whatevery creature you have imprisoned, it costs 100 gold
10. !prisoners --> it will show you, how many and which creatures you have imprisoned
11. !traps --> it will show you, how many traps and which traps you have (there is a maximum on traps, currently it is 5)
12. more will come!!!



# Keeper Chatgame Goldevent, lure Creatureevent, traps

if you wrote something in the Chat in the last 30 min you get 1 to 3 random creatures, one trap and gold. (You need to be a Keeper for this to work)

Every Imp you have increases the Goldincome by 1%.


# Keeper Chatgame Creatures

Right now there are 8 creatures available.

1. Imp (neutral)
2. Thief (good)
3. Bug (evil)
4. Ghosts (neutral)
5. Demonspawn (evil)
6. Archer (good)
7. Warlock (evil)
8. Barbarian (good)



# Keeper Chatgame Attack username details

Like in Dungeon Keeper you can or need to fight. =D

If you attack someone, your 10 strongest creatures will attack the enemy. Every creature fights 1 creature. There is always a random factor in it, so if the same creatures are fighting it will not end always in a draw.
For every surviving creature you gain 3% of the defenders gold.

In addition, there is a 5% chance on each win to capture the defeated creature and imprison it.



# Keeper Chatgame torture creature details

You can torture imprisoned creatures. They can turn and join your army or become ghosts. It is also possible that they just die from torture.



# just some words

I hope you are having fun playing this game. If you have any ideas or you find some bugs just tell me. I will take every useful input! =D

PS.: Working on an other chatbotgame right now!!!

Thank you for playing!
